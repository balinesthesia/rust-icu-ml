# Rust ICU ML
Hey, We're intensivist & anesthesiologits hacking Rust + ML to make ICU & OT life less insane. Follow or mess—steal it, break it, join in!
- Starting with: Pulse Checker (HR alerts). Follow our grind, steal the code, join the ride!

## Why Rust?
Fast, safe, perfect for ICU gear. Scary? Nah—start here:
- [Rust by Example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example): Quick code to play with.
- [The Rust Book](https://github.com/rust-lang/book): Deep dive if you’re hooked.

## Getting Started

### First Hack
- Pulse Checker: HR alerts for tachycardia—ICU life in code.

### Run It
- Grab it: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-icu-ml.git`
- Test it: `cd pulse_checker && cargo run`
- Hack it: Swap [120](_) for your patient’s HR—does it yell?
- New? Hit [Rust by Example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example)—start with “Hello, World” then tweak 120!

## For Juniors
No code exp? No stress. Check the links above—10 mins to “Hello,” then mess with this. Tag us if it breaks!
